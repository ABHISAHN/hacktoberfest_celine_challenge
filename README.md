# hacktoberfest_celine_challenge by @bloodstain5201

My friend Celine is new to web development, she just took a course from udemy and made a decent website using HTML, CSS and JS.

However, she faced some problems after she deployed it locally using Live Server VS Code extension. Your job is to complete the following tasks: 

1) Why the website is not showing up properly
2) After you're done with taking the website up, create a HAMBURGER for the navbar.

Happy Coding!
